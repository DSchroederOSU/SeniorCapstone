<p style="text-align: center; margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;">
This application was designed and created by a group of students at Oregon State University with the help of the Oregon State University Office of Sustainability
 to serve as their engineering capstone project.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;">
Oregon State University is constantly making strides to reduce its carbon footprint and reduce its energy consumption. 
OSU has carbon neutrality goal of 2025 and aims to generate as much energy as it uses to have a net carbon footprint of zero. 
This application will to monitor the energy usage of buildings on campus and create a visual representation of each building's 
energy consumption to inspire people to be more aware of their consumption habits so they may make choices to reduce the campus's overall consumption.
<br>
Essentially, this web application will be an administrative dashboard containing charts and graphs of energy usage rates for 
individual buildings and subgroups of buildings on Oregon State's campus. 
Public users may view energy usage data for all buildings on campus and authorized users will have access to personally 
generated stories of customized dashboards. Each buildings associated data page will display a dashboard of data blocks 
which contain charts or graphs of energy usage rates. Aside from the default building pages, authorized users customize 
their own dashboards for their own unique interests. An example of this would be a user created dashboard which displays 
energy data for all residence halls. Authorized users will be able to tailor their experience to their preference.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">History</h2>
<p style="text-align: center; margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;">The Oregon State University Sustainability Office is housed in the Finance and Administration division. The Sustainability Office was formed by the creation of a full time sustainability coordinator position in November 2005. In December 2007, an additional half-time position was created primarily to support the collection and management of campus utility data. In November 2008, the half-time position was moved to a permanent full time position and duties expanded to focus on energy conservation efforts.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Missions</h2>
<p style="text-align: center; margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;">The Sustainability Office exists to - in the most sustainable way possible - support OSU’s mission to promote economic, social, cultural and environmental progress for the people of Oregon, the nation and the world. The Sustainability Office fosters a culture of sustainability, enhances student competency around issues of sustainability, reduces the university’s overall environmental impact and communicates sustainability efforts to the campus community and external audiences. It aims to offer the highest quality of services to the OSU campus in its four functional areas:
</p>
