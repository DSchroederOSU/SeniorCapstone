    \end{itemize}  
    \vspace{-0.3cm}\noindent\textbf{Summary:}\\
    \noindent Communication between clients and group members has been established via Slack and other applications. Group has become more organized and meetings are scheduled for client. TA meeting times recommendations  have been scheduled, no official meeting time has been decided. We still need to figure out our work plan and what programs we will be using to build our project. We also still need to meet with client, which is scheduled for Tuesday 5:30-6:30, and hash out specific requirements of the project.

    \noindent Our backend is taking shape but is perhaps behind schedule, we are not retrieving any data to be put into graphs yet but seem to be getting close. Our google maps api for our homepage is almost complete but I need to figure out how to pass specific  building objects to get our building pages, a simple URL will not suffice, the data must be retrieved. The dashboards CSS has been adjusted to include a description

        \item Assigned me to charting tasks and daniel to authentication tasks
    \end{itemize} 
    \vspace{-0.3cm}\textbf{Problems:}
    \vspace{-0.5cm}
    \begin{itemize}

    \end{itemize}  
    \vspace{-0.3cm}\noindent\textbf{Summary:}\\
    \noindent Authentication has been completed by Daniel and I have completed the implementation of charts using Chart.js. These charts still need to have the ability to filter by date and filter using different data types but overall the API has been implemented.
\end{adjustwidth}

    \vspace{-0.3cm}\textbf{Problems:}
    \vspace{-0.5cm}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Finals week makes for difficulties to find time to complete all tasks.
		\item Charting API has some bugs when hovering over data points
    \end{itemize} 
    \vspace{-0.3cm}\noindent\textbf{Summary:}\\
    \noindent Our project is essentially coming to a close. We are almost entirely done with the application with a few small features missing. These features should not take very long to implement. Our charts now have more filters and displays on the buildings page correctly. Email API has been implemented but does not yet have the ability to set administrative privileges. My progress report is almost complete and the demo video should be complete by the due date.
